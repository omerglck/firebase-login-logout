## Firebase-Login-Logout

- Firebase is a cloud-based service that makes it easy for users to register, log in, reset and update their passwords.

- Users can register with your application using credentials such as email addresses and passwords. Firebase securely stores and manages these registrations.

- Registered users can log in to your application using their e-mail and password. Firebase monitors logged in users by managing user sessions.

- When users forget their password, Firebase facilitates the password reset process. Users can get a password reset link by entering their e-mail address.

- User profile information can be stored in Firebase's database and data storage services, depending on the requirements of your application. This allows users to update their profiles and allows other users to see these updates in real time.
